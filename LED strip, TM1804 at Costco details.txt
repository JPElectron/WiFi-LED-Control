Chip in the strip is: TM1804 (no English datasheet that I could find)
	each chip controls 6 LEDs in the strip
     1 section  = 12 LEDs (so 2 chips) with cut points at solder conn.
              all White / under 0.1Amp draw
	   2 sections = 24 LEDs @ 24VDC / all White / 0.11-0.12Amp draw
              (that's about 2.7w @ 24.88v or 2.9w @ 24.94v after WT-AF-24v as PS warms up)
	   7 sections = Full strip w/ plug conn. @ 24VDC / all White / 0.40Amp draw
							all Red   / 0.20Amp draw
							all Green / 0.19Amp draw
							all Blue  / 0.18Amp draw (note White LED is also on a small percent)
							RGB (all 3 on) / 0.28Amp draw
							light Blue / 0.31Amp draw
							Orange / 0.23Amp draw
							Yellow / 0.34Amp draw
							Purple / 0.32Amp draw

Same chip as sold in "Pololu" LED strips

They have an Arduino library...
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2543/resources
	https://github.com/pololu/pololu-led-strip-arduino

Also supported using FastLED library...
	http://fastled.io

Nothing I tried would compile on Digispark (due to 16.5Mhz instead of normal 16Mhz?)

Note strip is directional...
(data feed must come from left end when text is right side up)

On the LED strip...
Female plastic connector is for next strip or END (of two strips max)
Male plastic connector goes into IR/driver block

Does not light @ 12VDC
